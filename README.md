Hey BC team! 

I am submitting my bigcommerce.http file where the call can be run. I was unsuccessful in completing the task fully. 

I believe I am extremley close, however this is not a game of horseshoe.

Summary on status of Task One:
 I believe the issues with my widget and widget template are in the syntax.
 When using the calls to place the widget onto the storefront, the static images passed in via widget creation appear. 
 Howewver, they do not when dragging the template from the store builder onto the page. 
 Also there is only one image with the template, although I am using properties in my json blob to create an array of three images. 
 I was able to get three images to populate with soly my template, but not dynamically, therefore I removed that for my submission. 
 
 The graphQL script is successful in grabbing products with images.
 I attempted many times to incorporate this into my widget creation call but was unsuccessful in my attempts. 
 
 I believe I have most of the peices I need to complete the puzzle, just needing to put them together. 
 
 When pulling this file in, please make sure to update the credentials at the top and you can submit the calls directly from the file!
 :)
